# UEFI Calculator

Our Project is a UEFI Calculator that is capable of basic mathematical operations with a minimal UI.


## Tools
In this section, you should mention the hardware or simulators utilized in your project.
- Qemu
- OVMP
- EDK2


## Implementation Details

In this section, you will explain how you completed your project. It is recommended to use pictures to demonstrate your system model and implementation.


Feel free to use sub-topics for your projects. If your project consists of multiple parts (e.g. server, client, and embedded device), create a separate topic for each one.

## How to Run

In this part, you should provide instructions on how to run your project. Also if your project requires any prerequisites, mention them. 

#### Examples:
#### Build Project
Your text comes here
```bash
  build --platform=OvmfPkg/OvmfPkgX64.dsc --arch=X64 --buildtarget=RELEASE --tagname=GCC5
```
